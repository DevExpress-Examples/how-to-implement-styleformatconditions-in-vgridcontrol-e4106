# How to apply conditional formatting in the Vertical Grid control

In our v21.1 release cycle, users can utilize a row header's context menu to apply conditional formatting to data in the [Vertical Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/2449/controls-and-libraries/vertical-grid?v=21.1) control. You can use the control's [FormatRules](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraVerticalGrid.VGridControl.FormatRules?v=21.1) property to access, create, and modify format rules at design time or in code.
