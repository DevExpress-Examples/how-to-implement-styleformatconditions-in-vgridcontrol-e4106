' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to implement StyleFormatConditions in VGridControl
' 
' This example demonstrates how to implement StyleFormatConditions in
' VGridControl. The difficulty is in the fact that VGridControl doesn't implement
' the FormatConditions property at all, if compared to how this behavior is
' supported in GridControl. So, we created a custom class inherited from
' VGridControl and added the FormatConditions property to it. In this example we
' override the RecordCellStyle event to set a new style for VGridControl’s cells,
' which satisfy predefined conditions.
